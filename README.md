# 100 Days of Swift

## Intro
I started this project to follow along with [Paul Hudsonâ€™s 100 Days of Swift challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100).

This is just meant to refresh my skills in iOS Development as I feel like I've become rusty in the past 2 years and while I'm on career break as my first child just born so I'm helping  my wife to raise our newborn son, it is so challenging coz it's just the two of us. 

Looking forward to finish this in 100 days and get back in the field. I plan to start the 100 Days with SwiftUI alongside with this one. Let's go!
