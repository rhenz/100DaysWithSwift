# Day 8: structs, properties, and methods

## Notes

### Creating your own structs

In Swift, we can create our own types in two ways. The most common one is called Structures or simply _struct_

Structs can have their own variables and constants and their own functions. We can use them however we want.

Here is a very simple example of struct:
```swift
struct Sport {
	var name: String
}

// To create an instance of it
var tennis = Sport(name: "Tennis") 
print(tennis.name) // prints Tennis


// Since we made the instance a variable, we can change the property inside them
tennis.name = "Lawn Tennis"
```

By default, Structs in swift have a memberwise initializer that automatically generated by the compiler for structs that don't define a custom initializer like in our example. We can also create our own custom initializer if you need to.. But remember, if you make any of its properties a private access level, you need to make custom initializer, memberwise initializer won't work if you have private variables.

### Computed properties


```swift
struct Sport {
	var name: String
}
```

The `name` properties is called _stored property_, there is another kind of property called _computed property_ here's how it looks:

```swift
struct Sport {
	var name: String

	var isOlympicSport: Bool

    var olympicStatus: String {
        if isOlympicSport {
            return "\(name) is an Olympic sport"
        } else {
            return "\(name) is not an Olympic sport"
        }
    }
}

```


### Property observers

Property observers let you run code before or after any property changes:

```swift
struct Progress {
    var task: String
    var amount: Int {
        didSet {
            print("\(task) is now \(amount)% complete")
        }
    }
}

var progress = Progress(task: "Loading data", amount: 0)
progress.amount = 30
progress.amount = 80
progress.amount = 100
```

What happens here is it prints a message every time the `amount` changes, and we can use a didSet property observer for that.

We can also use `willSet` to take action before a property changes, but that is rarely used.


### Methods

Structs can have functions inside them. Functions inside structs are called _methods_.

```swift
struct City {
    var population: Int

    func collectTaxes() -> Int {
        return population * 1000
    }
}

let london = City(population: 9_000_000)
london.collectTaxes()
```


### Mutating methods

Whenever we need change the value of a variable in Struct's method, we need to make that method `mutating`.

Struct is a constant. So all of its properties are also constant regardless of how they were created.

```swift
struct Person {
    var name: String
    
    mutating func makeAnonymous() {
        name = "Anonymous"
    }
}

// Because this function changes a property,  Swift only allows that method to be called on instances that are variables(not constant)
//let person1 = Person(name: "Lucas")
//person1.makeAnonymous() // This will cause error as it changes a property inside the struct

var person = Person(name: "Chabby")
person.makeAnonymous()
```
