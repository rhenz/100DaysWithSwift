// Handling missing data using optionals

// Swift have optionals, you can make any time optional. Which means it can have a value or no value at all, which is nil in swift
var age: Int? = nil


age = 38

// age here is optional integer, meaning we still have to unwrap it if we want to use it like in arithmetic operation
