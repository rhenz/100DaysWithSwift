## Notes


### Challenges

2. Modify project 2 so that it saves the player’s highest score, and shows a special message if their new score beat the previous high score. - completed
3. Modify project 5 so that it saves the current word and all the player’s entries to UserDefaults, then loads them back when the app launches. - completed
