# Day 67: Project 19, Part One


## Notes
We are going to start a new project again today, and it's all about bridging an `iOS App` and `JavaScript running in Safari`



## Extensions
Extensions are miniature apps in their own right and we need to put them in their own space in our project.

To add an `extension`, go to `File menu` > `New` > `Target`, choose a template by selecting `iOS` > `Application Extension` > `Action Extension`

`Extension` will have their own folder in your project with `ActionViewController` and `MainInterface.storyboard`. 
`ActionViewController` has a code template in its `viewDidLoad` to load an item of type image by default.


On this project we also updated the Extension's plist. Just check the final changes of the plist in this project. We also created a javascript file inside the Extension folder.
