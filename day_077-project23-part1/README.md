# Day 77: Project 23

## Notes
- Setting Up
- Basic Quick Start: SKShapeNode
- Shaping up for action: CGPath and UIBezierPath
- Enemy or bomb: AVAudioPlayer


Today we are going to start again with a new SpritKit project. We are going to make a fruit ninja style game.


All that we've done today is just a preparation before we can truly play this game. Nothing is working yet aside from the slice effect.
