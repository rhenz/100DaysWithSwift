# Day 83: Project 25, Part One

## Notes
So today we are going to start again with a new project that will let us connect peer to peer for sharing/sending images using `MCSession` and `MCBrowserViewController`.


## MCSession
Manager class that handles all multipeer connectivity for us

## MCPeerID
Identifies each user uniquely in a session

## MCAdvertiserAssistant
Used when creating a session, telling others that we exist and handling invitation

## MCBrowserViewController
Used when looking for session, showing users who is nearby and letting them join
