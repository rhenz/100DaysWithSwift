# Day 90: Milestone: Projects 25-27

## Notes

## Challenge
Your challenge for this milestone is to create a _meme generation app_ using `UIImagePickerController`, `UIAlertController`, and `Core Graphics`. If you arenâ€™t familiar with them, memes are a simple format that shows a picture with one line of text overlaid at the top and another overlaid at the bottom.

Your app should:

- Prompt the user to import a photo from their photo library.
- Show an alert with a text field asking them to insert a line of text for the top of the meme.
- Show a second alert for the bottom of the meme.
- Render their image plus both pieces of text into one finished UIImage using Core Graphics.
- Let them share that result using UIActivityViewController.
