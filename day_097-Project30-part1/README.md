## Notes
Today, we are going to start with a new topid. We are going to learn how to use a dedicated tool called `Instruments` that can help us find and fix performance issues in code.

We are gonna learn about using the _Time Profiler_ and _Allocations_ intruments, how to draw shadows in both Core Graphics and CALayer, re-using table view cells in code, and etc..
