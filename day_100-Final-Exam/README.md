# Day 100: Final Exam

## Note

Finally! I completed this course! I'm so proud of myself that I was able to stay committed to do this every single day! Doing this I did not just learn iOS Development, but I also develop a good habit to stay committed to a thing you want to accomplish as long as you focus on your goal.
